# NLP-CyberSecurity-Analytics
Presentation for ICLR 2020 CyberSecurity social event

During the online ICLR this year, I got the chance to give a lightning talk on the intersection of CyberSecurity and NLP, in one of the conference socials. In particular, I chose the case of log analytics for intrusion detection and a couple of novel cases, where modern NLP has been tried and showed promising results.

- You can see the over here my [NLP for CyberSecurity presentation](./ICLR_Cybersecurity_NLP.pdf). Sorry for all the typos!

My aim in the end of the talk was to start a discussion, on the challenges that the field faces in order to mature and allow for open work. 

I find there is much promise in the field, as I have been working in User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) as a software engineer for several years. To get a hold of the area, from a business perspective, there is a handy summary that is updated every year by Gartner. 

- Read the [UEBA 2018 Market Guide](./gartner-market-guide-for-ueba-2018-analyst-report.pdf) to see what the fuss is about.

I find there is much more to see in applying Deep Learning to CyberSecurity in the future. Not just by repurposing NLP techniques, but by the entirety of the ML field.

- Finally, have a look at the copy of [A Comprehensive Tutorial and Survey of Applications of Deep Learning for Cyber Security in 2020](./IEEE_DL_Survey_exact.pdf), where there is a well structured organization of the intersection of the two fields.

Thanks for reading.
